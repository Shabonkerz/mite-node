<p class="lead">The goal of Mite is to make database migrations so simple and painless that doing migrations is easier than not doing them.</p>

<h2 id="tenets">Tenets of Mite</h2>

<ul>
  <li>SQL is a perfectly good DSL (Domain-Specific Language)</li>
  <li>Developers know and have tools for SQL.</li>
  <li>Down migrations are required for expected behavior on conflict resolution.</li>
  <li>Order is significant in migrations and is enforced.</li>
  <li>Migrations should be language agonostic. So a utility is appropriate.</li>
  <li>Database consistency with the migrations should be enforced. We should be aware of altered migrations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#">Download the distributable</a> or build from source.</li>
  <li>Add the location of Mite.exe to your PATH variable.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<h3 id="new-project">For new projects: </h3>
<p>It's best to have your migrations stay in their own folder, so create one for them: <kbd>mkdir migrations</kbd> (then <kbd>cd</kbd> into that folder).</p>
<p>Run <kbd>mite init</kbd> within this directory.  This will take you through a short wizard and spit out a config file that looks something like this:</p>
<pre>
  {
    "database": "mitedevel",
    "host": "localhost",
    "user": "mite",
    "password": "mite",
    "dialect": "mysql",
    "port": 3306
  }
</pre>

<p>Got it? Proceed to <a href="#first-migration">writing your first migration</a>.</p>


<h3 id="existing-project">For existing projects:</h3>
<p>Same steps as above. No, really.</p>

<h3 id="powering-up">Powering up an existing Mite project: </h3>
<p>Make sure that you have an empty database created and are in your scripts directory. Then run <kbd>mite update</kbd> and you're good to go.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="first-migration">Writing your first migration</h2>
<p>Migrations with Mite are literally just SQL (well, with some comments).</p>

<pre>
  /* up */
  CREATE TABLE dbo.test
    (
    id int NOT NULL
    )  ON [PRIMARY]
  GO
  /* down */
  drop table dbo.test
</pre>

<p>Running <kbd>mite -c</kbd> will create a template for you. Just fill it in with, yknow, SQL.</p>
